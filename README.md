# Digital Alarm Clock

Lab project for the second semester at ENTC-UoM

The purpose of this project is to present the design and construction of a digital clock fitted with an alarm circuit that operates at a frequency of 16MHz. This digital alarm clock is designed such that it uses a keypad for giving inputs, buttons to control the menu, an LCD display to visualize current time and date, and a buzzer to ring the alarm tones. Menu options range from core clock functionalities like setting the current date and time to setting the alarm time and the alarm tones.
